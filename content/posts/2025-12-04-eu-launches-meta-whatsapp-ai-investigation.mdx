The European Commission announced today it has launched a formal antitrust investigation into Meta's policies governing AI access to WhatsApp. EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager signaled that Brussels is considering interim measures—essentially forcing Meta to change course before the investigation concludes.

## The Core Concern

Meta recently updated its developer policies to control which AI providers can integrate with WhatsApp's messaging infrastructure. The EU's concern is straightforward: with WhatsApp's dominant market position in European messaging, these policies could determine which AI services can compete in Europe.

If Meta grants preferential access to its own AI products while restricting competitors, that's textbook anticompetitive behavior under EU law. The Commission appears to be treating this as urgent rather than letting a multi-year investigation play out.

## Why Interim Measures Matter

The mention of interim measures is significant. These are rarely used and require the Commission to demonstrate both serious harm and urgency. If imposed, Meta would need to modify its policies immediately, before any final ruling.

This suggests Brussels views the competitive harm as imminent. The AI market is developing rapidly, and a policy that locks out competitors now could create advantages that persist even if Meta eventually loses the case.

## Meta's Position

Meta has defended its policies as necessary for user privacy and platform security. Granting AI systems access to messaging data raises legitimate concerns about data protection—an area where the EU has been particularly aggressive with GDPR enforcement.

The tension here is real. Regulators simultaneously demand that platforms protect user data and ensure competitive access. Finding a policy that satisfies both requirements isn't trivial.

## The Broader Context

This investigation fits a pattern of EU scrutiny of how large platforms manage AI integration:

- **Apple** faces pressure over its App Store policies for AI apps
- **Google** continues to navigate antitrust challenges around search and Android
- **Microsoft** has been questioned about its relationship with OpenAI

The EU is effectively trying to establish competitive norms for AI before any single company achieves the kind of lock-in that proved so difficult to unwind in previous technology cycles.

## What Happens Next

Formal investigations typically take 12-18 months, but interim measures could come much sooner. Meta will need to demonstrate that its policies are genuinely neutral and that any restrictions are proportionate to legitimate security or privacy concerns.

For AI companies hoping to build products that integrate with major messaging platforms, this investigation could set important precedents. If the EU rules against Meta, it would signal that platform operators can't use their distribution power to favor their own AI services.

The outcome will be closely watched across the industry.
