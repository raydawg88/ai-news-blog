Large language models have reached a peculiar inflection point. They're simultaneously more capable than skeptics predicted and more limited than enthusiasts claim. Understanding this nuance is essential for anyone building with or investing in AI.

## What Actually Works

Let's start with what LLMs genuinely excel at:

**Code generation and assistance.** Models like GPT-4 and Claude can write functional code, explain complex algorithms, and debug issues. They're not replacing developers, but they're making experienced developers significantly more productive.

**Text transformation.** Summarization, translation, reformatting, and style transfer work remarkably well. These are tasks with clear success criteria where the model can be reliably evaluated.

**Information synthesis.** Given a body of text, LLMs can extract key points, identify patterns, and present information in requested formats. This is genuinely useful for research and analysis.

## What Still Doesn't Work

**Reliable factual accuracy.** Despite improvements, LLMs still hallucinate. They generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information with the same confidence as accurate statements. This isn't a training problem that will disappear with scale—it's a fundamental limitation of the architecture.

**Long-term reasoning.** Complex multi-step reasoning remains brittle. Models can solve impressive puzzles in isolation but struggle when problems require maintaining context across many reasoning steps.

**Genuine understanding.** LLMs are sophisticated pattern matchers, not knowledge repositories. They can manipulate symbols that represent concepts without truly understanding those concepts in the way humans do.

## The Honest Assessment

The most valuable perspective on LLMs is neither utopian nor dismissive. They're powerful tools with real limitations. The companies building successful AI products understand this—they use LLMs for tasks where their strengths align with requirements, and they implement guardrails for their weaknesses.

The hype cycle has been exhausting, but beneath it is genuine progress. The question isn't whether LLMs are transformative (they are) but how to deploy them responsibly and effectively.

We'll continue tracking developments as the field evolves. The technology is moving quickly, but clear thinking about capabilities and limitations remains more valuable than breathless speculation.
