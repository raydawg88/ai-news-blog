On November 25, 2024, Anthropic [released the Model Context Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) (MCP)—an open standard for connecting AI assistants to external data and tools. It's a technical infrastructure play that could reshape how AI applications are built.

## The Problem MCP Solves

Before MCP, connecting an AI model to external tools required custom integration work for every combination. Want Claude to access your company's Notion? Build a connector. Want it to query your database? Build another connector. Want it to use Slack? Another one.

Anthropic describes this as an "N×M" problem: N AI applications times M tools equals a lot of redundant integration work.

Previous solutions—like OpenAI's function calling and ChatGPT plugins—addressed pieces of this problem but were vendor-specific. MCP is designed to be a universal standard that any AI system can implement.

## How It Works

[MCP uses a client-server architecture](https://www.vktr.com/ai-technology/inside-anthropics-model-context-protocol-mcp-the-new-ai-data-standard/). AI applications (clients) connect to data sources and tools (servers) through a standardized protocol.

The technical details:

- **Transport**: JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio or HTTP (with optional SSE)
- **Message flow**: Deliberately similar to the Language Server Protocol (LSP) that powers IDE features
- **SDKs**: Available in Python, TypeScript, C#, and Java

For developers who've worked with LSP, this will feel familiar. The protocol handles the handshake, capability negotiation, and message routing—you just implement the actual functionality.

## What's Available Now

Anthropic released reference implementations for common integrations:

- **Enterprise tools**: Google Drive, Slack, Notion
- **Developer tools**: GitHub, Git, Postgres
- **Automation**: Puppeteer for browser control

More importantly, they released the specification as open source. Any company can build MCP servers without Anthropic's involvement.

## Early Adoption

The list of early adopters suggests where this is heading:

- **Replit** integrated MCP into their AI coding features
- **Cursor** uses it for contextual code assistance
- **Sourcegraph** adopted it for codebase understanding
- **Block** (Square's parent company) is implementing it for internal tools

These are developer-focused tools, which makes sense—developers are the ones who'd build the next wave of integrations.

## The Origin Story

[According to the creators](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/mcp), MCP emerged from internal frustration. David Soria Parra, one of the protocol's authors, was working on developer tooling at Anthropic:

> "Coming from a development tooling background, I quickly started to appreciate how amazing Claude Desktop is—with features like Artifacts—but got frustrated by how it had a limited feature set, with no way to extend it."

Rather than build one-off extensions, they created a protocol that could enable extensibility for any AI application.

## Why Open Source Matters Here

Anthropic could have kept MCP proprietary—a competitive moat for Claude. Instead, they open-sourced it and explicitly designed it to be model-agnostic.

The strategic logic: Anthropic benefits more from a healthy ecosystem of AI tools than from locking developers into Claude-specific integrations. If MCP becomes the standard, it reduces friction for the entire industry—including Anthropic's products.

This mirrors how companies like Google benefited from open-sourcing Kubernetes. The standard became infrastructure everyone builds on.

## What's Next

As of March 2025, OpenAI [announced they would adopt MCP](https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-model-context-protocol/) across their products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. This is the clearest signal yet that MCP could become the industry standard rather than just an Anthropic initiative.

For developers building AI applications: MCP is worth learning now. The protocol is stable, the tooling is maturing, and the adoption curve suggests it's not going away.
