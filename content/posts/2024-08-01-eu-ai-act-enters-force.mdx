On August 1, 2024, the [EU AI Act entered into force](https://commission.europa.eu/news-and-media/news/ai-act-enters-force-2024-08-01_en)—the first comprehensive legal framework for artificial intelligence anywhere in the world. After years of negotiation, amendments, and lobbying, the regulation is now law.

But "entered into force" doesn't mean "fully applicable." The Act rolls out in phases over the next two years, with different requirements kicking in at different times.

## The Risk-Based Framework

The AI Act categorizes AI systems by risk level, with requirements scaling accordingly:

**Unacceptable Risk (Banned)**:
- Social scoring systems by governments
- Emotion recognition in workplaces and schools
- Real-time biometric surveillance in public spaces (with exceptions)
- Manipulation techniques that exploit vulnerabilities
- Untargeted scraping for facial recognition databases

**High Risk (Strict Requirements)**:
- AI in critical infrastructure (energy, transport, water)
- Educational and vocational training systems
- Employment and worker management tools
- Access to essential services (credit, insurance, social benefits)
- Law enforcement applications
- Migration and asylum management
- Administration of justice

**Limited Risk (Transparency Obligations)**:
- Chatbots and conversational AI
- Emotion recognition systems (where allowed)
- Deepfake generators

**Minimal Risk (No Specific Requirements)**:
- AI-enabled video games
- Spam filters
- Most consumer applications

## The Implementation Timeline

The phase-in schedule:

**February 2, 2025** (6 months after entry into force):
- Bans on unacceptable-risk AI systems take effect
- This is the first hard deadline

**August 2, 2025** (12 months):
- Codes of practice for general-purpose AI
- Governance structures must be in place

**August 2, 2026** (24 months):
- Full application of the Act
- Most requirements become enforceable

**August 2, 2027** (36 months):
- High-risk systems in Annex I (regulated products) must comply
- Extended timeline for embedded AI in physical products

## What Companies Need to Do

For high-risk AI systems, the requirements are substantial:

**Risk Management**: Continuous assessment and mitigation of risks throughout the system lifecycle

**Data Governance**: Documentation of training data, including quality standards and bias assessment

**Technical Documentation**: Detailed records of how systems work, their capabilities, and limitations

**Transparency**: Clear information to users about AI involvement and system capabilities

**Human Oversight**: Mechanisms for human intervention and override

**Accuracy and Robustness**: Testing for performance, security, and reliability

**Record Keeping**: Automatic logging of system activities for auditing

## The GPAI Rules

General-purpose AI models (think: GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) face separate requirements:

**All GPAI providers must**:
- Maintain technical documentation
- Provide information to downstream deployers
- Establish copyright compliance policies
- Publish training content summaries

**Systemic risk models (very capable systems) additionally must**:
- Conduct model evaluations
- Assess and mitigate systemic risks
- Report serious incidents
- Ensure cybersecurity protection

The threshold for "systemic risk" is initially set at 10^25 FLOPs of training compute—a level currently reached only by frontier models from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and a few others.

## Penalties

The enforcement teeth are real:

- **Banned practices**: Up to €35 million or 7% of global annual turnover
- **High-risk non-compliance**: Up to €15 million or 3% of turnover
- **Incorrect information**: Up to €7.5 million or 1.5% of turnover

For large tech companies, these percentages translate to billions of euros in potential fines.

## Early Signals

Over 100 organizations signed the [AI Pact](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-pact), a voluntary commitment to implement AI Act principles before the legal deadlines. Signatories include major tech companies, consultancies, and AI developers.

This suggests at least some of the industry is taking compliance seriously rather than waiting for enforcement.

## What's Still Uncertain

Several implementation details remain unclear:

**Enforcement mechanisms**: How will regulators actually audit AI systems? The technical expertise required is scarce.

**Definition boundaries**: What exactly constitutes "high risk"? Edge cases will be contested.

**Cross-border application**: How does the Act apply to models developed outside the EU but used within it?

**Technical standards**: The harmonized standards that will define compliance aren't finalized.

**US reaction**: Will American companies comply, withdraw from Europe, or try to influence implementation?

## The Global Impact

Even if you're not in the EU, the AI Act matters:

**Brussels Effect**: Companies often implement the strictest standard globally rather than maintain separate versions

**Regulatory precedent**: Other jurisdictions (UK, Canada, Brazil) are watching and may follow

**Supply chain requirements**: If you sell to EU companies, their compliance obligations flow to you

**Model training**: Data from EU citizens may require special handling

The AI Act is now the baseline for global AI regulation. The question is whether others will match it, exceed it, or fragment.
