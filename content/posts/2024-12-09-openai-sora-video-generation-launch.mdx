On December 9, 2024, OpenAI [released Sora](https://openai.com/index/sora-is-here/) to the public—the video generation model they'd been teasing since February. After months of carefully curated demos and speculation about capabilities, anyone with a ChatGPT subscription can now generate video from text.

The launch came on day five of OpenAI's "12 Days of Shipmas" event, and demand was so high that the system immediately struggled under load.

## What Sora Can Do

The production version, called Sora Turbo, generates:

- **Resolution**: Up to 1080p
- **Duration**: Up to 20 seconds
- **Aspect ratios**: Widescreen, vertical, or square
- **Inputs**: Text prompts, images, or existing videos for remixing

[According to OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/sora-is-here/), users can "bring their own assets to extend, remix, and blend, or generate entirely new content from text."

The model handles basic physics, consistent characters across frames, and coherent camera movements. For short clips and specific use cases, it produces impressive results.

## What It Actually Costs

Sora is included with existing ChatGPT subscriptions, but with limits:

**ChatGPT Plus ($20/month)**:
- Up to 50 videos per month at 480p resolution
- Fewer videos at 720p
- Queue-based generation during peak times

**ChatGPT Pro ($200/month)**:
- 10x more usage than Plus
- Higher resolutions available
- Longer video durations
- Priority access

The $200 Pro tier is new, launched specifically for compute-intensive features like Sora and o1.

## The Limitations

OpenAI was unusually direct about what Sora can't do:

- **Unrealistic physics**: Objects sometimes defy gravity or pass through each other
- **Complex actions**: Multi-step sequences often fail
- **Long durations**: Quality degrades in longer videos
- **Consistency**: Characters may subtly change appearance within a clip

The demos from February were cherry-picked. Real-world generation requires iteration and luck to get usable results.

## Geographic Availability

Sora launched in the US and "most countries internationally," but notably not in Europe or the UK. OpenAI cited no timeline for those markets.

The European absence likely relates to the EU AI Act's requirements for generative content—labeling, transparency, and potential liability issues that OpenAI hasn't fully resolved.

## The Safety Measures

Every Sora video includes:

- **C2PA metadata**: Technical markers identifying content as AI-generated
- **Visible watermarks**: On by default in the interface
- **Internal detection**: OpenAI built tools to verify if content came from Sora

These measures address some concerns about deepfakes and misinformation, though they're not foolproof. Metadata can be stripped, and watermarks can be cropped or edited out.

## Competitive Context

Sora enters a market that developed while OpenAI delayed:

- **Runway Gen-3**: Established player with professional user base
- **Pika**: Fast iteration, popular with creators
- **Google Veo 2**: Announced shortly after Sora, potentially higher quality
- **Kling**: Chinese alternative with competitive capabilities

The first-mover advantage evaporated during the months between demo and launch.

## What This Means for Creators

For video professionals, Sora offers:

- **Rapid prototyping**: Visualize concepts before expensive production
- **B-roll generation**: Fill gaps without stock footage
- **Creative experimentation**: Try visual ideas without commitment

It doesn't replace production. The consistency issues make it unsuitable for primary footage in most professional contexts. But it expands what's possible in pre-production and ideation.

For platforms like TikTok and YouTube Shorts, the implications are more direct. Short-form video generation at this quality level changes the economics of content creation.

## The Deeper Questions

Sora's release surfaces issues the industry has been avoiding:

**Training data**: What videos was Sora trained on? OpenAI hasn't disclosed, and content creators are asking.

**Economic displacement**: If AI can generate video, what happens to stock footage companies, VFX artists, and video editors?

**Authenticity**: In a world where video is trivially fabricated, how do we trust what we see?

These aren't hypotheticals anymore. Sora makes them immediate.
